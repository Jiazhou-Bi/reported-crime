# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @Python3 and @TorontoOpenData.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-asdfafdesadfsdfas), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-asdfafdesadfsdfas
#| fig-cap: Number of marriage licenses in Toronto, by civic center (2011 - 2024)
#| echo: false

data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, 
             y = marriage_licenses,
             color = civic_centre)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = lubridate::ymd("2020-03-13"),
              linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Number of marriage licenses",
       color = "Location")
```
